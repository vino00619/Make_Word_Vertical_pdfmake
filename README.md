# Make_Word_Vertical_pdfmake
This repo has the code to make a word vertical (angle - 90 deg) using pdf make library in Javascript

I used pdf make to render a pdf, and at this time of creating this repo (2024), there was no reference to make the text vertical.
The script uses HTMLCanvas to rotate the text in to an angle of 90 degrees and takes a snip (screenshot) of it and uses it in the pdf make as an image.

Hope this repo was helpful!
